## Commands

Set custom hotkeys for these commands in Obsidian's Hotkeys settings:

**View & navigation**

- `Notebook Navigator: Open` Opens Notebook Navigator in left sidebar. If already open, focuses the file list pane. **Suggestion:** Bind to a shortcut key like `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+E` to move keyboard focus to the list pane - **this is essential for full keyboard navigation**
- `Notebook Navigator: Open homepage` Opens the Notebook Navigator view and loads the homepage file configured in settings
- `Notebook Navigator: Reveal file` Reveals current file in navigator. Expands parent folders and scrolls to file. This command is useful if you have the setting `Auto-reveal active note` switched off and want to reveal notes manually
- `Notebook Navigator: Navigate to folder` Search dialog to jump to any folder
- `Notebook Navigator: Navigate to tag` Search dialog to jump to any tag
- `Notebook Navigator: Search` Opens quick search field or focuses it if already open. Search persists between sessions. **Suggestion:** Bind to a shortcut key like `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+F` for quick file filtering

**Layout & display**

- `Notebook Navigator: Toggle dual pane layout` Toggle single/dual-pane layout (desktop)
- `Notebook Navigator: Toggle descendants` Toggle descendants notes display for both folders and tags. **Suggestion:** Bind to a shortcut key like `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+S` to quickly toggle display of notes from descendants
- `Notebook Navigator: Toggle hidden items` Show or hide excluded folders and hidden tags
- `Notebook Navigator: Collapse / expand all items` Collapse or expand all items based on the current state. When `Keep selected item expanded` is enabled (default on), all folders except the current one will be collapsed. This is super handy to keep the navigation tree tidy when searching for documents. **Suggestion:** Bind to a shortcut key like `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+C` to quickly collapse non-selected items

**File operations**

**Note:** When creating new notes in Obsidian you can choose the `Default location for new notes` in Obsidian settings. This can be the the root folder, same folder as current file, or a specific folder. When working with Notebook Navigator, especially with the setting `Show notes from descendants` enabled, none of these options are preferred. Instead you always want to create new notes in the currently selected folder (for example if you have `Show notes from descendants` on, and have a note in a descendant folder selected, you do not want the new note to appear in the descendant folder). The same also applies to moving and deleting files. This is why you should use these commands instead of the built-in Obsidian commands when using Notebook Navigator.

- `Notebook Navigator: Create new note` Create note in currently selected folder. **Suggestion:** Bind `Cmd/Ctrl+N` to this command (unbind from Obsidian's default "Create new note" first)
- `Notebook Navigator: Move files` Move selected files to another folder. Selects next file in current folder
- `Notebook Navigator: Delete files` Delete selected files. Selects next file in current folder

**Tag operations**

- `Notebook Navigator: Add tag to selected files` Dialog to add tag to selected files. Supports creating new tags
- `Notebook Navigator: Remove tag from selected files` Dialog to remove specific tag. Removes immediately if only one tag
- `Notebook Navigator: Remove all tags from selected files` Clear all tags from selected files with confirmation

**Maintenance**

- `Notebook Navigator: Rebuild cache` Rebuilds the local Notebook Navigator cache. Use this if you experience missing tags, incorrect previews or missing feature images

  - **Hidden tags:** Comma-separated list of tag prefixes or name wildcards. Use `tag*` or `*tag` to match tag names. Hiding a tag also hides all its sub-tags (e.g., "archive" hides "archive/2024/docs")

### Search

- **Search provider:** Choose between quick file name search or full-text search with Omnisearch plugin
  - **Filter search (default):** Fast, lightweight search that filters files by name and tags within the current folder and subfolders. Supports tag filtering with # prefix (e.g., #project), exclusion with ! prefix (e.g., !draft, !#archived), and finding untagged notes with !#. Ideal for quick navigation within your current context
  - **Omnisearch:** Full-text search that searches your entire vault, then filters the results to show only files from the current folder, subfolders, or selected tags. Requires the [Omnisearch](https://github.com/scambier/obsidian-omnisearch) plugin to be installed - if not available, search will automatically fall back to Filter search
    - **Known limitations:**
      - Performance can be slow, especially when searching for less than 3 characters in large vaults
      - Cannot search in paths with non-ASCII characters and does not search subpaths correctly
      - Since Omnisearch searches the entire vault and returns a limited number of results before filtering, relevant files from your current folder may not appear if too many matches exist elsewhere
      - Note previews are replaced with Omnisearch result excerpts, which may not show the actual search match highlight

### List pane

- **Sort notes by:** Choose how notes are sorted in the note list. `Date edited (newest/oldest first)`, `Date created (newest/oldest first)`, `Title (A-Z first)`
- **Multi-select modifier:** Choose which modifier key toggles multi-selection. When Option/Alt is selected, Cmd/Ctrl click opens notes in a new tab. `Cmd/Ctrl click`, `Option/Alt click`
- **Group notes by date:** When sorted by date, group notes under date headers
- **Optimize note height:** Reduce height for pinned notes and notes without preview text
- **Show quick actions (desktop only):** Show hover actions on file items
  - **Reveal in folder:** Quick action: Reveal note in its parent folder. Only visible when viewing notes from subfolders or in tags (not shown in the note's actual folder)
  - **Pin note:** Quick action: Pin or unpin note at top of list
  - **Open in new tab:** Quick action: Open note in new tab
- **Date format:** Format for displaying dates (uses date-fns format)
- **Time format:** Format for displaying times (uses date-fns format)

### Notes

- **Read metadata from frontmatter (\*):** Read note names and timestamps from frontmatter when available, falling back to file system values
- **Name field:** Frontmatter field to use as the note display name. Leave empty to use the file name
- **Created timestamp field:** Frontmatter field name for the created timestamp. Leave empty to only use file system date
- **Modified timestamp field:** Frontmatter field name for the modified timestamp. Leave empty to only use file system date
- **Timestamp format:** Format used to parse timestamps in frontmatter. Leave empty to use ISO 8601 format
- **Title rows:** Number of rows to display for note titles. `1` or `2`
- **Show date:** Display the date below note names
- **Show file tags:** Display clickable tags in file items. Use tag colors to visually distinguish different tag types
  - **Show file tags in slim mode:** Display tags when date, preview, and image are hidden
- **Show parent folder names:** Display the parent folder name for notes in subfolders or tags
- **Show note preview (\*):** Display preview text beneath note names
  - **Preview rows:** Number of rows to display for preview text. `1-5`
  - **Skip headings in preview:** Skip heading lines when generating preview text
  - **Skip code blocks in preview:** Skip code blocks when generating preview text
  - **Preview properties:** Comma-separated list of frontmatter properties to check for preview text. The first property with text will be used
- **Show feature image (\*):** Display thumbnail images from frontmatter. Tip: Use the "Featured Image" plugin to automatically set feature images for all your documents
  - **Image properties:** Comma-separated list of frontmatter properties to check for thumbnail images. The first property with an image will be used. If empty and the fallback setting is enabled, the first embedded image will be used
  - **Use embedded image fallback:** Use the first embedded image in the document as a fallback when no thumbnail is found in frontmatter properties (requires Obsidian 1.9.4+). Disable this to verify that thumbnails are properly configured

**Note:** When date, preview, and feature image are disabled, list pane displays in compact "slim mode" with only note names.

### Hotkeys

- Edit `<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/notebook-navigator/data.json` to customize shortcuts. Locate the `keyboardShortcuts` section and define entries in this format:

```json
"pane:move-up": [
  { "key": "ArrowUp", "modifiers": [] },
  { "key": "K", "modifiers": [] }
]
```

- Standard modifiers:
  - `"Mod" = Cmd (macOS) / Ctrl (Win/Linux)`
  - `"Alt" = Alt/Option`
  - `"Shift" = Shift`
  - `"Ctrl" = Control (prefer "Mod" for cross-platform)`

- Add multiple mappings to support alternate keys, as shown above. Combine modifiers in one entry by listing each value, for example `"modifiers": ["Mod", "Shift"]`. Keyboard sequences (for example `"gg"` or `"dd"`) are not supported. Reload Obsidian after editing the file.

### Advanced

- **Confirm before deleting:** Show confirmation dialog when deleting notes or folders
- **Clean up metadata:** Removes orphaned metadata left behind when files, folders, or tags are deleted, moved, or renamed outside of Obsidian. This includes file icons, file colors, folder customizations, tag customizations, and pinned notes
- **Rebuild cache:** Use this if you experience missing tags, incorrect previews or missing feature images. This can happen after sync conflicts or unexpected closures

_(\*) These settings store data to a local cache database. You can see the total size of the database at the bottom of the Settings pane. Uncheck each item to remove its data from the cache._
